# Tasks

Open tasks only, one block each (format in `pipeline/README.md`). The planning thread writes blocks; a build thread
takes one, and its block leaves this file in the pull request that lands it. Its record (`docs/records/<id>.md`) and
its changelog note remain. The order is `docs/ROADMAP.md` › Build order.


## MN3 · Opponents and Teammates on the Match screen
tier: ui
perf: optional
touches: game/ui/match_page.gd, game/ui/match_options.gd, game/ui/match_picks.gd, game/ui/text/en.po, game/main.gd,
  tests/unit/
contract: none
acceptance:
  1. The BOTS section has an Opponents row and a Teammates row as concepts `bots-follow.png` and `bots-picked-dev.png`
     show (`/mnt/project-files/concepts/step12-bots/`, approved by the owner 2026-10-22 11:49), each level with its
     blurb (the browser game's DIFFICULTIES and TEAMMATE_DIFFICULTIES) and the opponents' XP multiplier.
  2. Teammates read FOLLOWS OPPONENTS and follow the opponents' pick until you pick one (Normal against Easy,
     BotConfig.teammates_following); the summary line names both when they differ.
  3. The picks reach PlaySession.difficulty and teammate_difficulty.

## AD1 · Adaptive difficulty (Dev)
when: build order step 31, after the late features (owner, 2026-10-22)
tier: core
perf: optional
touches: game/ai/, game/config/, game/save/dev_settings.gd, game/ui/settings_screen.gd, game/play/play_session.gd,
  game/ui/xp_card.gd, game/progress/, tests/
contract: Data, not literals (6); Saves (8)
acceptance:
  1. A Dev switch makes the other team's skill a rating that blends the levels' numbers (the browser game's
     adaptiveDifficulty.ts): up a little after a round or match you win, down after one you lose, within its limits;
     the on/off habits come from the nearest level and stay fixed through a match. It never changes a level's own
     numbers (DECISIONS 2026-10-06).
  2. Your teammates never adapt; an adaptive match gives no XP and stays out of the records.
  3. The rating is saved and the end-of-match card says where the next match starts.
