# Tasks

Open tasks only, one block each (format in `pipeline/README.md`). The planning thread writes blocks; a build thread
takes one, and its block leaves this file in the pull request that lands it. Its record (`docs/records/<id>.md`) and
its changelog note remain. The order is `docs/ROADMAP.md` › Build order.

## WL10 · Woodland's match guards, balance and performance (Dev)
when: build order step 26, last
tier: core
perf: required
touches: tests/guards/test_match_guards.gd, tests/guards/test_flag_guards.gd, tests/balance/balance_run.gd,
  tests/support/match_runner.gd, tools/match_guards.sh, .github/workflows/ci.yml, docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md,
  docs/PLAYTEST.md, docs/DECISIONS.md
contract: none
acceptance:
  1. The match guards play Woodland Elimination and Attack / Defend at 5v5 at night, on 16 seeds at Normal and the
     levels' seeds at Easy, Hard and Pro: rounds settle; nobody is stuck, falls or is hit by a teammate. Should the
     guards' CI job pass its time limit, Woodland gets a job of its own.
  2. The balance report covers Woodland's modes and levels. A figure outside its band (Normal 45 to 55 %, Pro 40 to
     60 %) goes to the owner beside the browser's figures (M88, FO1, its WL2), never into a looser band.
  3. The record gives Woodland's frame time, draw calls and triangles at 5v5 and 6v6 on every preset, against Low's
     60 FPS target; each gap is a KNOWN_ISSUES row.
  4. PLAYTEST › Woodland lists what to try (both camps, the fort, the ravine, bushes, the torch on and off, glowing
     BBs, 6v6). The owner makes Woodland public when he is happy.

## AD1 · Adaptive difficulty (Dev)
when: build order step 27, with the other deferred features (owner, 2026-10-24)
tier: core
perf: optional
touches: game/ai/, game/config/, game/save/dev_settings.gd, game/ui/settings_screen.gd, game/play/play_session.gd,
  game/ui/xp_card.gd, game/progress/, tests/
contract: Data, not literals (6); Saves (8)
acceptance:
  1. A Dev switch makes the other team's skill a rating that blends the levels' numbers (the browser game's
     adaptiveDifficulty.ts): up a little after a round or match you win, down after one you lose, within its limits;
     the on/off habits come from the nearest level and stay fixed through a match. It never changes a level's own
     numbers (DECISIONS 2026-10-06).
  2. Your teammates never adapt; an adaptive match gives no XP and stays out of the records.
  3. The rating is saved and the end-of-match card says where the next match starts.
