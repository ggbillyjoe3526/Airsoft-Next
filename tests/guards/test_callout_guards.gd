## The callouts' guards (CO1; the browser game's depotMatch.callouts.test.ts, CL1): whole bot matches with the shipped
## data/callouts.md. On every field (Depot in both modes, Woodland at night) a seeded match plays the same with the
## callouts as without: the same shots, hits, rounds and flag; a replay says the same calls. On every map every call
## keeps the pace (one a team a tick, the team's and the bot's gaps), comes from a bot in play during a live round and
## fits a feed line, and the calls come at a steady rate; the rates print beside the browser's for the record. Run by
## tools/match_guards.sh, a CI job of its own.
