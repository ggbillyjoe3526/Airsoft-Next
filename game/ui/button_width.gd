class_name ButtonWidth
extends RefCounted
## The menus' one rule for button widths (owner, 2026-10-29): a button is as wide as its words plus the theme's padding,
## and the buttons in one group (a row, a column or a bar on one screen) all take the widest one's width, so the group
## reads even and none has a field of empty space in it.
##
## `ButtonWidth.group(buttons)` sets each button's `custom_minimum_size.x` to the widest `get_minimum_size().x` (the
## button's own size, which leaves out `custom_minimum_size`, so measuring never feeds back) and makes it hug that width
## instead of filling its container. A group measures itself again when a button's words, font or theme change
## (`minimum_size_changed`), so a translation, a rebound key name or a theme that arrives once the buttons are in the tree
## all settle on their own. Each button keeps its group (meta), so nothing else needs to hold it, and it goes with them.

## The meta a button keeps its group in, and the one a button keeps its overlay in (see `overlay`).
const META := &"button_width"
const OVERLAY_META := &"button_overlay"
## The room kept between a button's words and its overlay's (px).
const OVERLAY_GAP := 24.0

## Untyped: a freed button is only a stale entry, skipped.

## How the buttons sit in a container wider than they are.
var _align: Control.SizeFlags = Control.SIZE_SHRINK_BEGIN
## The width the group has now (px).
var _width: float = 0.0


## Makes `buttons` one group, hugging the container's start (`align` SHRINK_BEGIN), or its middle or end.

## Tells the group that `overlay`, a control drawn over the right of `b` (the pause menu's ON and OFF chips, a key's cap),

## The width every button in the group has (px).
