class_name WindowWatch
extends Node
## The window's keys and focus, everywhere (menus, play, the pause menu): F11 or Alt+Enter switches between a window and
## the last fullscreen mode and saves it (SettingsApply.toggle_fullscreen), and while the game is in the background
## (unfocused or minimised) it draws DisplayConfig.background_fps (SettingsApply.set_focused).
##
## The keys are read in `_input`, before a focused button takes Enter. A node later in the tree has its `_input` first,
## and the main scene adds this before any settings screen or match, so a key list waiting for a key to bind takes F11
## and Alt+Enter itself.

## What it switches and saves; the game's own when unset.
var settings: Settings = null
## Where it saves (a test points this at a temporary file).
var save_path: String = Settings.PATH
