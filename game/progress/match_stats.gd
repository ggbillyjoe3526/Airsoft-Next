extends RefCounted
## Every player's numbers for the match so far and for the round in play, or the one just played (the browser game's
## stats/matchStats.ts), read from each tick's events: what the scoreboard, the round result and the match summary show.
## Reads the simulation, never writes it. Round 1's start begins a new match (a rematch too).
